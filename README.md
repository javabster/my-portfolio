This is my first ever online web development portfolio, it  is still a work in progress, but as I am a full time student (who teaches herself web development in her spare time) I do not have as much time as I would like to keep it up to date.

To view the webpage please go to: https://javabster.github.io/my-portfolio/

With regards to the spinning profile picture:
Much like Marmite or Taylor Swift, opinions are divided on this feature.
Every web developer I have shown this to either loves it or hates it!
What do you think?
Let me know!
